//! Where eunha deliberately differs from the Mastodon release it implements.
//!
//! Eunha aims for behavioural parity, so a difference is either a bug or a
//! decision. `divergences.toml` is where the decisions are recorded, and this
//! module reads it so that tests can hold it to the code — prose that nothing
//! checks is prose that stops being true.
//!
//! The part that earns its keep over time is [`Divergence::reviewed_for`]:
//! adopting a newer Mastodon release fails the suite until every entry has been
//! re-examined against it. A divergence that was right against one release is
//! not automatically right against the next, and upstream may have adopted the
//! same idea, changed the thing being diverged from, or ruled it out.
